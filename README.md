High-performance Windows library for capturing decoded FFXIV packets. This
library is fairly limited in scope and it is intended to be used in conjunction
with other packet handling applications.

## Features

  - This library can be used as a sniffer on the FFXIV packet protocol layer
    without concern for the lower-level TCP layer.
  - Deucalion runs as an injected DLL and hooks the function responsible for
    reading decoded packets. Therefore, this method of capture is not susceptible
    to the limitations of libpcap-based capture.
  - Deucalion functions as a broadcast server that streams captured packets to
    one or many subscribers.

## Building

1. Install the nightly version of
  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Windows.

2. `git clone` this repo.

3. `cd` into `deucalion` and run `cargo build`. The DLL will be located in
  `target/debug/deucalion.dll`.

> :information_source: A console window will appear when the DLL is running
> if the DLL is compiled in the debug profile. To hide the console window,
> compile the DLL in the release profile by supplying `--release` to
> the `cargo build` command.

## Basic Usage

On initialization, Deucalion exposes a
[Named Pipe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes)
server that follows a length-delimited protocol for capturing packets or for
subscriber requests.

1. Inject `deucalion.dll` into `ffxiv_dx11.exe` with any method you choose. If
   built in debug mode, a console window will appear after attaching.
1. Initiate a Named pipe session with Deucalion by connecting to
  `\\.\pipe\deucalion-{FFXIV PID}`. For example, if the PID of a running
  FFXIV process is 9000, then the name of the pipe is
  `\\.\pipe\deucalion-9000`.
1. Deucalion will begin broadcasting received Zone packets to all subscribers.
   See [Data Format](#data-format) for information on the format of the
   broadcasted packets.
1. Deucalion will close and unload itself once all subscribers are disconnected.

> :information_source: By default, Deucalion's will not send you packets for
> anything other than received Zone packets. To allow other packet types, please
> see the [Option OP](#option-op) section.

## Payload Format

All communication with Deucalion follows this length-delimited protocol (ranges
are inclusive):

| bytes [0, 3] | byte 4 | bytes [5, 8] | bytes [9, N] |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| LENGTH (u32) | OP     | CHANNEL      | DATA         |

### Length

This is the total length of the entire payload, including the length bytes.

### OP Types

| OP  | Name      | Description                                                                                                                       |
| --- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Debug     | Used for passing debug text messages.                                                                                             |
| 1   | Ping      | Used to maintain a connection between the subscriber and Deucalion. Deucalion will echo the same payload when it receives a ping. |
| 2   | Exit      | Used to signal Deucalion to unload itself from the host process. In most use cases, you will not need to send this OP at all.     |
| 3   | Recv      | When sent from Deucalion, contains the FFXIV IPC packet received by the host process.                                             |
| 4   | Send      | When sent from Deucalion, contains the FFXIV IPC packet sent by the host process.                                                 |
| 5   | Option    | Used to configure per-subscriber filtering for packets.                                                                           |
| 6   | RecvOther | When sent from Deucalion, contains the FFXIV non-IPC segment received by the host process.                                        |
| 7   | SendOther | When sent from Deucalion, contains the FFXIV non-IPC segment sent by the host process.                                            |


### Channel

This is an identifier for the channel used for the payload. It is used to
distinguish between streams of data (e.g., Zone packets vs Chat packets).

For `Recv` and `Send` OPs, the following CHANNELs correspond to these packet
types:

| CHANNEL | Name  |
| ------- | ----- |
| 0       | Lobby |
| 1       | Zone  |
| 2       | Chat  |


For the `Debug` OP, the CHANNEL 9000 indicates the `HELLO` CHANNEL.

### Data

For payloads with OP `Debug`, the payload is simply debug-logged.

For payloads with OP `Recv` or `Send`, the data is the FFXIV IPC packet captured
from the host process. The packets are already in the correct order, but they
still need to be decoded by your application. See [Data Format](#data-format)
for more information on how to handle this data.

Payloads with OP `RecvOther` or `SendOther` will contain FFXIV non-IPC segments
captured from the host process. This is also discussed in
[Data Format](#data-format).


## Subscriber Protocol

The Deucalion server is capable of receiving and handling requests from the
subscriber. The CHANNEL field is used to send request context, and Deucalion
will reply to the requesting subscriber with a `Debug`-OP payload with the same
CHANNEL.

### Debug OP

Any payload sent with the `Debug` OP with a CHANNEL other than `HELLO` will be
simply be debug-logged and an `OK` response will be sent back to the requesting
subscriber.

For payloads with the `Debug` OP and the `HELLO` channel, the DATA sent will
be set as the nickname for the current subscriber.

These are the restrictions on the values of nickname that are accepted:
- The bytes in DATA must be valid UTF-8.
- Must contain only ASCII alphanumeric characters or underscores (`^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$`)
- Must be 30 characters or less
- Names are allowed to be the same as other subscribers.

For example:
```c
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 9000, DATA: u8"TEST_CLIENT" }
// Deucalion: Nickname set response
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 9000, DATA: u8"CHANGED NICKNAME: TEST_CLIENT (subscriber 0)" }
```

### Ping OP

Any `Ping`-OP payload sent to Deucalion will be echoed back to the requesting
subscriber.

### Exit OP

Deucalion will immediately begin unloading all hooks and cleaning itself from
the host process without sending a response back to the subscriber.

> :warning: It is not required to send this OP to Deucalion! Deucalion will
> safely exit on its own once all subscribers are disconnected. Causing Deucalion
> to exit early may cause undefined behavior in subscribers that are still
> connected.

### Recv OP

In most cases, subscribers do not need to send a `Recv` OP payload to
initialize the hook. However if the hook has not been automatically initialized,
then subscribers may send a pattern signature as a UTF-8-encoded string in a
`Recv` OP payload in order to manually initialize the hook.

See [Example](#example) for this scenario.  For information on the signature
format, please see
https://docs.rs/pelite/latest/pelite/pattern/fn.parse.html.

> :warning: Once the Recv hook is initialized, all subscribers will receive the
> packet stream regardless of whether or not their own initialization succeeded.
> As such, it is wise to begin handling data as soon as the named pipe
> connection is established and handle initialization asynchronously.

### Send OP

What applies to `Recv` OP payloads sent from subscribers also applies to `Send`
OP payloads sent from subscribers.

However, payloads with CHANNEL set to `0` will initialize the `SendLobbyPacket`
hook.  Payloads with any other CHANNEL value will initialize the `SendPacket`
hook (handles Chat and Zone.)

### Option OP

By default, Deucalion sets a per-subscriber filter that allows only `Recv`
Zone payloads to be sent to the subscriber.

Each subscriber can customize their own filter for what `Recv` or `Send` packets
are sent by Deucalion. Other payload OPs such as `Debug` are not affected by
this filter.

Filters can be set by sending an `Option` OP with bitflags as the CHANNEL.

| Flag   | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1 << 0 | Allows received Lobby packets.         |
| 1 << 1 | Allows received Zone packets.          |
| 1 << 2 | Allows received Chat packets.          |
| 1 << 3 | Allows sent Lobby packets.             |
| 1 << 4 | Allows sent Zone packets.              |
| 1 << 5 | Allows sent Chat packets.              |
| 1 << 6 | Allows other packet types or channels. |

For example, to allow received Zone, received Chat, sent Zone, and sent Chat
packets, you can compute the filter value:
```c
54 == (1 << 1 | 1 << 2 | 1 << 4 | 1 << 5)
```
and send the payload:
```c
Payload { OP: OP.Option, CHANNEL: 54, DATA: <empty>}
// Deucalion: Filter set response
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 0, DATA: u8"Packet filters set: 0b00110110" }
```

#### Error Handling

Deucalion will gracefully handle error cases by responding with a `Debug`-OP
Payload containing the error message. The error cases that are handled include
but are not limited to:
  - DATA could not be decoded as a string.
  - The string could not be parsed as a valid signature.
  - The signature could not be found in memory.
  - The hook was already initialized.

## Examples
Here is an example interaction between Deucalion and a subscriber:

Connecting to Deucalion will automatically allow traffic to start flowing
to the subscriber.

```c
// Deucalion: Connection established message.
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 9000, DATA: u8"SERVER HELLO. VERSION: 1.0.0. HOOK STATUS: RECV ON. SEND ON. SEND_LOBBY ON." }
// Deucalion: Data streamed to all subscribers
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: deucalion_segment }
...
```

### Example when Deucalion requires sigs
```c
// Deucalion: Connection established message.
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 9000, DATA: u8"SERVER HELLO. VERSION: 1.0.0. HOOK STATUS: RECV OFF. SEND OFF. SEND_LOBBY OFF." }
// Subscriber: Request with an invalid sig.
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: u8"invalid sig" }
// Deucalion: Response with an invalid sig error.
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: u8"Error setting up hook: Invalid signature: \"invalid sig\"..." }
// Subscriber: Request with a valid sig (as of FFXIV global version 6.35).
// Deucalion will gracefully allow subscribers to try again after an error.
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: u8"E8 $ { ' } 4C 8B 43 10 41 8B 40 18" }
// Deucalion: OK response
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: u8"OK" }
// Deucalion: Data streamed to all subscribers
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: deucalion_segment }
```

### Example when attempting to reinitialize hook

If the Recv hook is already initialized, then the following scenario can happen:

```c
// Deucalion: Connection established message.
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 9000, DATA: u8"SERVER HELLO. VERSION: 1.0.0. RECV ON. SEND ON. SEND_LOBBY ON." }
// Deucalion: Data streamed to all subscribers
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: deucalion_segment }

// Subscriber: Asynchronous task sending request with an valid sig.
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: u8"E8 $ { ' } ..." }
// Deucalion: Response with already initialized error.
Payload { OP: OP.Debug, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: u8"Error setting up hook: Detour is already initialized" }

// Deucalion: Data streamed to all subscribers
Payload { OP: OP.Recv, CHANNEL: 1, DATA: deucalion_segment2 }
```

If the hook has been partially initialized, then it may be necessary to
recompile Deucalion with new sigs.

## Data Format

Data broadcasted with the `Recv` or `Send` OP is sent to subscribers in a
Deucalion-specific format:

```c
struct DEUCALION_SEGMENT {
  uint32_t source_actor;
  uint32_t target_actor;
  uint64_t timestamp; // milliseconds since UNIX epoch
  FFXIVARR_IPC_HEADER ipc_header; // Includes reserved, type (opcode), serverId, etc.
  uint8_t packet_data[];
}
```

Data broadcasted with the `RecvOther` or `SendOther` OP is sent to subscribers
as a plain FFXIV segment:

```c
struct FFXIV_SEGMENT {
  FFXIVARR_PACKET_SEGMENT_HEADER segment_header;
  uint8_t segment_data[];
}
```

Refer to https://xiv.dev/network/packet-structure for more info.

### Details

There are a multitude of terms out there for describing the same data
structures and it may sometimes be confusing, so let's clarify what we mean by
*FFXIV packet*.

TCP data arrives in individual units called *segments*, which may also be called
*TCP packets*.

FFXIV data arrives in containers that are called a multitude of
different things, but ultimately it does not matter so we'll call them *frames*
here.  On the wire, they may be split across multiple TCP segments, but this is
a detail that is abstracted away here.

Each frame contains data that is potentially compressed, and this data typically
includes one or more *FFXIV segments*. Each segment encapulates segment header
information and the data, which is what we actually refer to as the *FFXIV
packet data*.

Using names from https://xiv.dev/network/packet-structure, the following is a
diagram of what this looks like. Deucalion extracts the innermost packet data
after it has been decoded and decompressed.
